# Welcome to my website!

### Who am I?

My name is Rayyan Nasr. I am a Lebanese Canadian undergraduate student at the [American University of Beirut](https://aub.edu.lb). I am a senior student at AUB hoping to graduate with a Bachelor in Engineering degree in Computer and Communications Engineering. My focus is on all things software, especially making them smart with a little machine learning.

My hobbies include reading (biographies and cheesy horror/thriller stephen king books), going to the gym, and catching up on the latest Netflix has to offer.
