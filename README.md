# Welcome to my website!

### Who am I?

My name is Rayyan Nasr. I am a Canadian Machine Learning enthusiast. I obtained my Bachelors in Engineering degree (BE) in Computer and Communications Engineering from the [American University of Beirut](https://aub.edu.lb) and my Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu). My focus is on all things software, especially making them smart with a little machine learning.

My hobbies include reading (biographies and cheesy horror/thriller stephen king books), going to the gym, and catching up on the latest Netflix has to offer.

### What have I or currently am working on?

* [h-baselines](https://github.com/alt113/h-baselines.git): A repository of high-performing hierarchical reinforcement learning models and algorithms.
* [flow](https://github.com/flow-project/flow.git): Computational framework for reinforcement learning in traffic control
* [Hierarchical-Actor-Critc-HAC-](https://github.com/alt113/Hierarchical-Actor-Critc-HAC-.git): This repository contains the code to implement the Hierarchical Actor-Critic (HAC) algorithm.
* [Feudal-Networks](https://github.com/alt113/Feudal-Networks.git): Continuation of https://github.com/dmakian/feudal_networks
* [NL-FuN](https://github.com/alt113/NL-FuN.git): N-Layered FeUdal Networks based on FeUdal Networks adapted to suit PySC2 observations
* [NGS](https://github.com/traffic-control-fyp-aub/ns3-gym.git): The playground for reinforcement learning in networking research with SUMO integration.
* [Improving Unimodal Testing via Multimodal training](https://github.com/alt113/CS591-Multimodal-Spring2021.git): This research project aimed at improving the results of unimodal testing when certain or most modalities are not available at test time, but are available at train time.
* [StyleTransferGAN](https://github.com/alt113/CS585-Style-Transfer-GAN.git): This research project was aimed at testing the limits of style transferability of transfer GANs (different lighting, skin tone, facial structures, paint strokes).
* [Multilingual Twitter Classification](https://github.com/alt113/CS505-Spring-MultiLingual-Twitter-Classification.git): This research project was aimed at proving whether or not multilingual models have an advantage over unilingual models when performing sentiment classification in different languages.
* [NAACP Spark](https://github.com/alt113/naacp-spark-fall2020.git): This project involves building on a proof of concept for evaluating media coverage of Black Americans in Boston for the past 5 years including sentiment analysis, levels of overall coverage, homicide coverage, and unique topic words used around black people and predominantly black neighborhoods and sub-neighborhoods.

### Organizations

I am a member of the [Flow](https://flow-project.github.io) organization which is a deep reinforcement learning framework for mixed autonomy traffic developed by UC Berkeley. I am also a member and administrator at [Traffic Control FYP AUB](https://github.com/traffic-control-fyp-aub).
